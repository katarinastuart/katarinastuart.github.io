Below is a collection of vignettes I have made over the years. My general goal is to try create one vignette per first author paper, in it capturing some aspect of the data processing or analysis that I had to learn for the project. My aim in creating these is is threefold:<br>
1. increase my research repeatability and transparancy
2. provide a starting point for other researches who need help with the code
3. reflect on new program/techniques learnt duing projects and note areas of improvment for the future

I do not imagine these vignettes are free from errors, however if you spot any major ones or would just like general assistance with anything feel free to contact me.

In addition to this, workshops have been developed for:
- [Genetic Outlier Analysis](https://github.com/katarinastuart/Ev1_SelectionMetaAnalysis)
