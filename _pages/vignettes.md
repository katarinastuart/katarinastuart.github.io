Below is a collection of vignettes I have made over the years. My general goal is to create one vignette per first author paper, in it capturing some aspect of the data processing or analysis that I had to learn for the project. My aim in creating these is is threefold:<br>
1. increase my research repeatability and transparancy
2. provide a starting point for other researches who need help with the code
3. reflect on new program/techniques learnt duing projects and note areas of improvment for the future

I do not imagine these vignettes are free from errors, however if you spot any major ones or would just like general assistance with anything, feel free to contact me.
