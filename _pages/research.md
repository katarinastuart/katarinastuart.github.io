**Greening Australia (2025)**
Featured in “How plant DNA will help shape the future of native seed production areas,” [article](https://www.greeningaustralia.org.au/how-plant-dna-will-help-shape-the-future-of-native-seed-production-areas/) showcasing how my research is shaping real-world strategies for restoring Australia’s native flora through genomics.

**The Science Writer (2023)**
My research was [profiled](https://www.thesciencewriter.org/enigma-stories/more-than-a-murmur-invasive-starlings-alaska) in “More Than a Murmur,” a deep dive into the surprising genetic edge of invasive starlings—and how my work is rewriting what we know about rapid evolution.

**Boiling Point Science Podcast (2020 & 2022)**
Guest speaker on Sydney’s longest-running science radio show, where I unpacked the genomic secrets of invasive species and what they tell us about evolution in real time.

**Australian National Museum – Science Week (2014–2019)**
Long-time volunteer for National Science Week, leading school tours and hands-on demos to bring evolutionary biology and biodiversity to life for thousands of curious minds.

**Friends of Fogg Dam (2016)**
Invited speaker for this grassroots restoration group in the NT, sharing my Honours research on wetland invaders and sparking community conversation on ecological resilience.
