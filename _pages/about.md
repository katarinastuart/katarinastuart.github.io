My interests are in invasion biology, exploring the evolutionary mechanisms that drive a successful invasive species. Successful introduced species pose an ecological and financial threat in their invaded range, but also provide an important opportunity to observe rapid evolution within a species as it responds to new ecosystems. Studying the genetic and phenotypic change in invasive species is of great interest to me, as this has applications in many scientific fields, including but not limited to pest control, conservation, organism response to climate change, and general evolutionary mechanisms.
