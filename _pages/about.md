I am an **evolutionary and conservation genomicist** investigating how genetic variants - from single nucleotide polymorphisms to large-scale structural changes - mediate adaptation across spatial and temporal scales. My research encompasses both invasive and native species, including plants and animals, with the objective of elucidating how **diverse forms of genetic variation underpin population resilience or vulnerability** in the face of environmental change.

A central focus of my work is on genetic diversity, emphasizing the roles of sequence variation, structural variants, and transposable elements in facilitating rapid evolutionary responses. By integrating genomics with ecological context, I seek to advance fundamental understanding of evolutionary mechanisms and inform evidence-based conservation strategies.

**A holistic view of genetic variation**

I am at the forefront of redefining how we study genetic differences between individuals. With whole genome resequencing data become more available, my current research directions exploring how structural variants and transposable elements should be incorporated into population genomics and conservation. This includes empirical studies, linking [variant impact to fitness](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.17631), and [patterns of diversity to population histories and evolutionary processes](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/40/3/msad046/7052962). This also includes [examining the theory of SVs](https://www.authorea.com/doi/full/10.22541/au.174853973.36642913/v1) by exploring their fundamental nature and properties (i.e. how they arise and are maintained in the genome), with the resulting suggestion that these variants should not be treated as a cohesive group. Profiling previously understudied elements of inter-individual genetic variation through whole-genome sequencing is the next step in evolutionary genomics. Integrating these complex variants into genomic research will help address the issue of missing heritability, improve our ability to predict the outcome of conservation breeding and translocation programs, and allow us to more fully profile adaptive potential under a future of climate change.

**Beyond outliers: Using genetic outliers to investigate broader evolutionary hypotheses.**

Evolutionary genomic studies often produce a list of genetic sites flagged as under putative selection or associated with phenotype or environment data. 
<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/images/research_map3.png">
While generating a shortlist of biologically interesting variants is the first of many steps towards biologically validating these results, it is vital that we go beyond compilation of outlier loci and begin using this often end-result as a stepping stone to further scientific inquiry. To this end, I have been awarded funding from the <a href="https://ausevo.com/ECR_grants_2022/"> AES ERC Networking Grant Scheme</a> and <a href="https://genetics.org.au/">GSA</a> to develop workshop material for [genetic outlier analysis](https://github.com/katarinastuart/Ev1_SelectionMetaAnalysis). The ultimate goal of this project will be to develop cross species and cross study analyses (metanalyses) to interrogate a diverse list of species and population for broad trends that characterize genetic variants and regions undergoing contemporary selection.

**The invasion genomics of the European starling**

The European starling *Sturnus vulgaris*, is one of the most widespread and iconic invasive avian species. However, despite their invasive range success, native starling populations are collapsing, with declines of up to 90% in the European countries they occupy. The global spread of this invasive species also provides unique opportunities to contrast genetic divergence across multiple invasive ranges, providing insight into the malleability of invasion regimes. I have worked across reduced representation sequencing (Stuart & Cardilini *et al* [2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.15601)), whole genome resequencing (Hofmeister *et al* [2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.19.442026v1.abstract), Stuart *et al* [2023](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msad046)), museomics (Stuart *et al* [2022a]( https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.16353)), and morphological data (Stuart *et al* [2022b](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.824424)) to investigate the genetic underpinnings of the starlingâ€™s adaptive patterns across their global range, with a particular emphasis on the Australian population.
