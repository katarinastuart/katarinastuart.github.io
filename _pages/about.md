I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Sydney in 2017, after spending six months at a research station in the Northern Territory, running a common garden experiment for my honours research project. I am currently a PhD candidate in the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of New South Wales, Australia.

I spend a lot of my working hours writing code, fixing code, and then writing about why I wrote the code in the first place. A small portion of my time is spent retrieving code deleted by Toothless the shingleback, as we walks thoughtlessly across my keyboard. When not doing research, I fill my days with art, gardening, baking, reading, and games (board games, DnD, and computer games, I love them all).
