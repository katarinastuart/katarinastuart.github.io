I love all things evolutionary biology. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Sydney in 2017. For my honours thesis, I spent six months at a research station in the Northern Territory, running a common garden experiment focusing on cane toad behavious and morphology. I completed my Ph D in the School of Biological, Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of New South Wales, Australia, in 2022. For my PhD research, I pivoted away from field ecology and into genomics, working primarily on the invasive European starling within Australia. I am currently working as a Research Fellow in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Auckland.

I enjoy working in the field and in the wetlab, though ultimately spend a large portion of my time at the computer analysing genetic data sets. I spend many of my working hours writing code, fixing code, and then writing about why I wrote the code in the first place. A small portion of my time is spent retrieving code deleted by Toothless the shingleback, as he walks thoughtlessly across my keyboard.

When not doing research, I fill my days with art, gardening, baking, reading, and gaming (board games, DnD, and computer games, I love them all).
